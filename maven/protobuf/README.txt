Google protocol buffers support library
=======================================

If you are using maven to build this code, you need to have the correct version
of the google protocol buffers library installed in your local repository. Run
install.sh (Unix systems) or install.bat (windows) to do this.

For other build environments, just make sure that the file protobuf-java-2.3.0.jar
is on both your build and runtime classpath.
