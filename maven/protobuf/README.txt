Google protocol buffers support library
=======================================

If you are using maven to build this code, you need to have the version 2.3.0
of the google protocol buffers library installed in your local repository. Run
install.sh (Unix systems) or install.bat (windows) to do install the prebuilt
jar in this directory to your local repository.

For other build environments, just make sure that the file protobuf-java-2.3.0.jar
is on both your build and runtime classpath.
